{"body":"## Summary\n- Implemented the missing FASTA export functionality in the BatchExport component\n- Resolved TODO comment at line 224 in src/lib/BatchExport.svelte\n\n## Changes\n- Added imports for file storage utilities and FASTA parsing functions\n- Implemented `exportCorrectedFasta` function that:\n  - Retrieves the original file content from IndexedDB storage\n  - Parses the FASTA content using existing validation utilities\n  - Formats the sequences with proper line wrapping (60 characters)\n  - Exports the file with an appropriate filename suffix (_exported.fasta)\n\n## Technical Notes\nThe datareader analysis results don't contain corrected sequence data - they only store metadata about the sequences. Therefore, the implementation exports the original FASTA content from the stored file, which is the most appropriate solution given the current data structure.\n\n## Test Plan\n- [ ] Upload a FASTA file and run a datareader analysis\n- [ ] Navigate to the batch export section\n- [ ] Select the datareader analysis\n- [ ] Verify that the FASTA export function works correctly\n- [ ] Check that the exported file contains the expected sequences","labels":[],"title":"Implement FASTA export functionality in BatchExport component"}
